you can just open it and click play but you will need to install Guido first. 

## downloading Guido library

Guido is a library we used that helps to build the slider object you see in our vis. 

### To download:

For reference:

https://github.com/fjenett/Guido

In processing for the mac, in the sketch tab, there is a command that says import library. When you click on that it will open a window and you will just type Guido and it will appear. CLick on install in the bottom and it will install it. You will need to restart processing after and then open our file and click play.
