Capstone Project 

## Inspiration

We wanted to center our project around film. Seeing the over done analyzation of the diversity in Hollywood, we decided it would be a better to study the different genre popularity ternds over the last 30 years based on major current events that have happened. Was there a correlation between the rise and fall of certain movie genre over the past 30 years and the various current events happening in the United States?

To begin our research, we looked at various literature that centered around film analysis, interactivity, and node network maps. We had seen the static depictions of Hollywood diversity produced by different media analytic and thought we could do a network map connecting genres with current events. Once we saw the large amount of data we were dealing with, a node network map would be cluttered and unorganized. We had to rethink our stratey.

## Interactivity 

We decided an interactive visualization would be the best way to show the change in movie genre popularity. A radial pie chart we decided was the best way to show changing time series data. 

There is a slider timeline that when you drag it from left to right, the radial pie chart adjusts and if there is an event that pertains to that year, then it will show under the slider with a picture, title, and one or two sentence description of the event. When the user mouses over a specific genre, the genre name appears and the average gross revenue and number of movies for that given genre in that year appears.  

## Encoding
The width of a genre indicates the number of movies and the length of a genre segment indicates the amount of money made. Therefore long skinny genres indicate a genre where there were few movies that made a lot of money.
